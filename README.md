# Vorto IoT Graphical System Modeler
Web based IoT Graphical System Modeler
Date : 19/08/2016

Implemented by - Tharindu Madushanka Peiris

Mentor -  Nagavijay Sivakumar

Under the Google summer of code 2016 
Eclipse foundation 

### Project Background 
[Vorto](http://www.eclipse.org/vorto/) is an IoT toolset for eclipse that allows users to describe characteristics and services of real world devices in a technology agnostics language, so-called information models.  

The scope of this project is to logically extend the existing Vorto modeling capabilities. Vorto Web based IoT System Modeling tool provides user to design/model the IoT solution in a graphical way using web browser (Chrome/Firefox) using HTML5 canvas. This was undertaken as a joint collboration by Google Summer of Code - Eclipse Foundation, which was mentored by myself with the graduate student.   

### Features 
- Drag and Drop IoT elements (sensors, devices, gateways, cloud services etc) in HTML canvas in browser.
- Import/Export the IoT System modeler diagram. 
- Import/Export IoT System Modeler semantic metadata.
- Programatically Add/Remove and Group IoT graphical elements.     

   
##### Project Demo - http://nagavijays.github.io/vorto-web-modeler/

##### Project Documentation - http://nagavijays.github.io/vorto-web-modeler/docs/index.html

### Notes 
This project is still in alpha phase and still needs close integration with Vorto Repository and implement appropriate system level code generators for bootstrapping of the entire IoT solution. 
The scope of this tool is to show the graphical designing of IoT system with browser canvas, create IoT solutions graphically.
