# Vorto IoT Graphical System Modeler
Web based IoT Graphical System Modeler
Date : 19/08/2016

Implemented by - Tharindu Madushanka Peiris

Mentor -  Nagavijay Sivakumar

Under the Google summer of code 2016 
Eclipse foundation 

### Project description 
   Vorto is an IoT toolset for eclipse that allows users to describe characteristics and services of real world devices in a technology agnostics language, so-called information models. The information models are hosted in a centralized Information Model Repository. Vorto Code Generators then translate the information models into platform - specific code.The Vorto Web based IoT System Modeling tool provides user to design/model the IoT solution in a graphical way using web browser (Chrome/Firefox) using HTML5 canvas.

### Features: 
- Drag and Drop IoT elements (sensors, devices, gateways, cloud services etc) in HTML canvas in browser.
- Import/Export the IoT System modeler diagram. 
- Import/Export IoT System Modeler semantic metadata.
- Programatically Add/Remove and Group IoT graphical elements.     

   
##### Project Demo - http://nagavijays.github.io/vorto-web-modeler/

##### Project Documentation - http://nagavijays.github.io/vorto-web-modeler/docs/index.html

### Notes: 
This project is still in alpha phase and still needs realtime integration with Vorto Repository and implement code generators necessary for bootstrapping of the entire IoT solution. 
The scope of this tool is to show the graphical designing of IoT system with browser canvas.
